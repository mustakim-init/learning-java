**Control Statements**

A programming language uses *control* statements to cause the flow of execution to advance and branch based on changes to the state of a program. Java’s program control statements can be put into the following categories: selection, iteration, and jump. *Selection* statements allow your program to choose different paths of execution based upon the outcome of an expression or the state of a variable. *Iteration* statements enable program execution to repeat one or more statements (that is, iteration statements form loops). *Jump* statements allow your program to execute in a nonlinear fashion. All of Java’s control statements are examined here.

## Java’s Selection Statements

Java supports two selection statements: `if` and `switch`. These statements allow you to control the flow of your program’s execution based upon conditions known only during run time. You will be pleasantly surprised by the power and flexibility contained in these two statements.

### if

The `if` statement was introduced in Chapter 2. It is examined in detail here. The `if` statement is Java’s conditional branch statement. It can be used to route program execution through two different paths. Here is the general form of the `if` statement:

if (*condition*) *statement1*; else *statement2*; Here, each *statement* may be a single statement or a compound statement enclosed in curly braces (that is, a *block*). The *condition* is any expression that returns a `boolean` value. The `else` clause is optional.

The `if` works like this: If the *condition* is true, then *statement1* is executed. Otherwise, *statement2* (if it exists) is executed. In no case will both statements be executed. For example, consider the following:

```java
int a, b;
//...
if(a < b) a = 0;
else b = 0;
```

<!-- CR p.88 -->

Here, if `a` is less than `b`, then `a` is set to zero. Otherwise, `b` is set to zero. In no case are they both set to zero.

Most often, the expression used to control the `if` will involve the relational operators. However, this is not technically necessary. It is possible to control the `if` using a single `boolean` variable, as shown in this code fragment:

```java
boolean dataAvailable;
//...
if (dataAvailable)
  ProcessData();
else
  waitForMoreData();
```

Remember, only one statement can appear directly after the `if` or the `else`. If you want to include more statements, you’ll need to create a block, as in this fragment:

```java
int bytesAvailable;
// ...
if (bytesAvailable > 0) {
  ProcessData();
  bytesAvailable -= n;
} else
  waitForMoreData();
```

Here, both statements within the `if` block will execute if `bytesAvailable` is greater than zero.

Some programmers find it convenient to include the curly braces when using the `if`, even when there is only one statement in each clause. This makes it easy to add another statement at a later date, and you don’t have to worry about forgetting the braces. In fact, forgetting to define a block when one is needed is a common cause of errors. For example, consider the following code fragment:

```java
int bytesAvailable;
// ...
if (bytesAvailable > 0) {
  ProcessData();
  bytesAvailable -= n;
} else
  waitForMoreData();
  bytesAvailable = n;
```

It seems clear that the statement **bytesAvailable = n**; was intended to be executed inside the `else` clause, because of the indentation level. However, as you recall, whitespace is insignificant to Java, and there is no way for the compiler to know what was intended. This code will compile without complaint, but it will behave incorrectly when run. The preceding example is fixed in the code that follows:

```java
int bytesAvailable;
// ...
if (bytesAvailable > 0) {
  ProcessData();
  bytesAvailable -= n;
} else {
  waitForMoreData();
  bytesAvailable = n;
}
```

<!-- CR p.89 -->

##### Nested ifs

A *nested* `if` is an `if` statement that is the target of another `if` or `else`. Nested `if`s are very common in programming. When you nest `if`s, the main thing to remember is that an `else` statement always refers to the nearest `if` statement that is within the same block as the `else` and that is not already associated with an `else`. Here is an example:

```java
if(i == 10) {
  if(j < 20) a = b;
  if(k > 100) c = d; // this if is
  else a = c;        // associated with this else
}
else a = d;          // this else refers to if(i == 10)
```

As the comments indicate, the final `else` is not associated with `if(j<20)` because it is not in the same block (even though it is the nearest `if` without an `else`). Rather, the final `else` is associated with `if(i==10)`. The inner `else` refers to `if(k>100)` because it is the closest `if` within the same block.

##### The if-else-if Ladder

A common programming construct that is based upon a sequence of nested `if`s is the *if-else-if* ladder. It looks like this:

if(*condition*) *statement*; else if(*condition*) *statement*; else if(*condition*) *statement*; . . . else *statement*; The `if` statements are executed from the top down. As soon as one of the conditions controlling the `if` is `true`, the statement associated with that `if` is executed, and the rest of the ladder is bypassed. If none of the conditions is true, then the final `else` statement will be executed. The final `else` acts as a default condition; that is, if all other conditional tests fail, then the last `else` statement is performed. If there is no final `else` and all other conditions are `false`, then no action will take place.

Here is a program that uses an `if-else-if` ladder to determine which season a particular month is in.

```java
// Demonstrate if-else-if statements.
class IfElse {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int month = 4; // April
    String season;

    if(month == 12 || month == 1 || month == 2)
      season = "Winter";
    else if(month == 3 || month == 4 || month == 5)
      season = "Spring";
    else if(month == 6 || month == 7 || month == 8)
      season = "Summer";
    else if(month == 9 || month == 10 || month == 11)
      season = "Autumn";
    else
      season = "Bogus Month";

    System.out.println("April is in the " + season + ".");
  }
}
```

<!-- CR p.90 -->

Here is the output produced by the program:

```text
April is in the Spring.
```

You might want to experiment with this program before moving on. As you will find, no matter what value you give `month`, one and only one assignment statement within the ladder will be executed.

### The Traditional switch

The `switch` statement is Java’s multiway branch statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of your code based on the value of an expression. As such, it often provides a better alternative than a large series of `if-else-if` statements.

At the outset, it is necessary to state that beginning with JDK 14, the `switch` has been significantly enhanced and expanded with several new features that go far beyond its traditional form. The traditional form of `switch` has been part of Java from the beginning and is, therefore, in widespread use. Furthermore, it is the form that will work in all Java development environments and for all readers. Because of the substantial nature of the recent `switch` enhancements, they are described in Chapter 17, in the context of other recent additions to Java. Here, the traditional form of the `switch` is examined. Here is the general form of a traditional `switch` statement:

switch (*expression*) { case *value1*: // statement sequence break; case *value2*: // statement sequence break; . . .

<!-- CR p.91 -->

case *valueN* : // statement sequence break; default: // default statement sequence }

For versions of Java prior to JDK 7, *expression* must resolve to type `byte`, `short`, `int`, `char`, or an enumeration. (Enumerations are described in Chapter 12.) Today, *expression* can also be of type `String`. Each value specified in the `case` statements must be a unique constant expression (such as a literal value). Duplicate `case` values are not allowed. The type of each value must be compatible with the type of *expression*.

The traditional `switch` statement works like this: The value of the expression is compared with each of the values in the `case` statements. If a match is found, the code sequence following that `case` statement is executed. If none of the constants matches the value of the expression, then the `default` statement is executed. However, the `default` statement is optional. If no `case` matches and no `default` is present, then no further action is taken.

The `break` statement is used inside the `switch` to terminate a statement sequence. When a `break` statement is encountered, execution branches to the first line of code that follows the entire `switch` statement. This has the effect of “jumping out” of the `switch`.

Here is a simple example that uses a `switch` statement:

```java
// A simple example of the switch.
class SampleSwitch {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for(int i=0; i<6; i++)
      switch(i) {
        case 0:
          System.out.println("i is zero.");
          break;
        case 1:
          System.out.println("i is one.");
          break;
        case 2:
          System.out.println("i is two.");
          break;
        case 3:
          System.out.println("i is three.");
          break;
        default:
          System.out.println("i is greater than 3.");
      }
  }
}
```

The output produced by this program is shown here:

```text
i is zero.
i is one.
i is two.
i is three.
i is greater than 3.
i is greater than 3.
```

<!-- CR p.92 -->

As you can see, each time through the loop, the statements associated with the `case` constant that matches `i` are executed. All others are bypassed. After `i` is greater than 3, no `case` statements match, so the `default` statement is executed.

The `break` statement is optional. If you omit the `break`, execution will continue on into the next `case`. It is sometimes desirable to have multiple `case`s without `break` statements between them. For example, consider the following program:

```java
// In a switch, break statements are optional.
class MissingBreak {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for(int i=0; i<12; i++)
      switch(i) {
        case 0:
        case 1:
        case 2:
        case 3:
        case 4:
          System.out.println("i is less than 5");
          break;
        case 5:
        case 6:
        case 7:
        case 8:
        case 9:
          System.out.println("i is less than 10");
          break;
        default:
          System.out.println("i is 10 or more");
      }
  }
}
```

This program generates the following output:

```text
i is less than 5
i is less than 5
i is less than 5
i is less than 5
i is less than 5
i is less than 10
i is less than 10
i is less than 10
i is less than 10
i is less than 10
i is 10 or more
i is 10 or more
```

As you can see, execution falls through each `case` until a `break` statement (or the end of the `switch`) is reached.

<!-- CR p.93 -->

While the preceding example is, of course, contrived for the sake of illustration, omitting the `break` statement has many practical applications in real programs. To sample its more realistic usage, consider the following rewrite of the season example shown earlier. This version uses a `switch` to provide a more efficient implementation.

```java
// An improved version of the season program.
class Switch {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int month = 4;
    String season;

    switch (month) {
      case 12:
      case 1:
      case 2:
        season = "Winter";
        break;
      case 3:
      case 4:
      case 5:
        season = "Spring";
        break;
      case 6:
      case 7:
      case 8:
        season = "Summer";
        break;
      case 9:
      case 10:
      case 11:
        season = "Autumn";
        break;
      default:
        season = "Bogus Month";
    }
    System.out.println("April is in the " + season + ".");
  }
}
```

As mentioned, you can also use a string to control a `switch` statement. For example,

```java
// Use a string to control a switch statement.

class StringSwitch {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    String str = "two";

    switch(str) {
      case "one":
        System.out.println("one");
        break;
      case "two":
        System.out.println("two");
        break;
      case "three":
        System.out.println("three");
        break;
      default:
        System.out.println("no match");
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- CR p.94 -->

As you would expect, the output from the program is

```text
two
```

The string contained in `str` (which is "two" in this program) is tested against the `case` constants. When a match is found (as it is in the second `case`), the code sequence associated with that sequence is executed.

Being able to use strings in a `switch` statement streamlines many situations. For example, using a string-based `switch` is an improvement over using the equivalent sequence of `if/else` statements. However, switching on strings can be more expensive than switching on integers. Therefore, it is best to switch on strings only in cases in which the controlling data is already in string form. In other words, don’t use strings in a `switch` unnecessarily.

##### Nested switch Statements

You can use a `switch` as part of the statement sequence of an outer `switch`. This is called a *nested* `switch`. Since a `switch` statement defines its own block, no conflicts arise between the `case` constants in the inner `switch` and those in the outer `switch`. For example, the following fragment is perfectly valid:

```java
switch(count) {
  case 1:
    switch(target) { // nested switch
      case 0:
        System.out.println("target is zero");
        break;
      case 1: // no conflicts with outer switch
        System.out.println("target is one");
        break;
    }
    break;
  case 2: // ...
```

Here, the **case 1:** statement in the inner switch does not conflict with the **case 1:** statement in the outer switch. The `count` variable is compared only with the list of cases at the outer level. If `count` is 1, then `target` is compared with the inner list cases.

In summary, there are three important features of the `switch` statement to note:

- The `switch` differs from the `if` in that `switch` can only test for equality, whereas `if` can evaluate any type of Boolean expression. That is, the `switch` looks only for a match between the value of the expression and one of its `case` constants.

<!-- CR p.95 -->

- No two `case` constants in the same `switch` can have identical values. Of course, a `switch` statement and an enclosing outer `switch` can have `case` constants in common.
- A `switch` statement is usually more efficient than a set of nested `if`s.

The last point is particularly interesting because it gives insight into how the Java compiler works. When it compiles a `switch` statement, the Java compiler will inspect each of the `case` constants and create a “jump table” that it will use for selecting the path of execution depending on the value of the expression. Therefore, if you need to select among a large group of values, a `switch` statement will run much faster than the equivalent logic coded using a sequence of `if-else`s. The compiler can do this because it knows that the `case` constants are all the same type and simply must be compared for equality with the `switch` expression. The compiler has no such knowledge of a long list of `if` expressions.

**REMEMBER** Recently, the capabilities and features of `switch` have been substantially expanded beyond those

offered by the traditional `switch` just described. Refer to Chapter 17 for details on the enhanced `switch`.

## Iteration Statements

Java’s iteration statements are `for`, `while`, and `do-while`. These statements create what we commonly call *loops*. As you probably know, a loop repeatedly executes the same set of instructions until a termination condition is met. As you will see, Java has a loop to fit any programming need.

### while

The `while` loop is Java’s most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or block while its controlling expression is true. Here is its general form:

while(*condition*) { // body of loop }

The *condition* can be any Boolean expression. The body of the loop will be executed as long as the conditional expression is true. When *condition* becomes false, control passes to the next line of code immediately following the loop. The curly braces are unnecessary if only a single statement is being repeated.

Here is a `while` loop that counts down from 10, printing exactly ten lines of "tick":

```java
// Demonstrate the while loop.
class While {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 10;

    while(n > 0) {
      System.out.println("tick " + n);
      n--;
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- CR p.96 -->

When you run this program, it will “tick” ten times:

```text
tick 10
tick 9
tick 8
tick 7
tick 6
tick 5
tick 4
tick 3
tick 2
tick 1
```

Since the `while` loop evaluates its conditional expression at the top of the loop, the body of the loop will not execute even once if the condition is false to begin with. For example, in the following fragment, the call to `println()` is never executed:

```java
int a = 10, b = 20;

while(a > b)
  System.out.println("This will not be displayed");
```

The body of the `while` (or any other of Java’s loops) can be empty. This is because a *null statement* (one that consists only of a semicolon) is syntactically valid in Java. For example, consider the following program:

```java
// The target of a loop can be empty.
class NoBody {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i, j;

    i = 100;
    j = 200;

    // find midpoint between i and j
    while(++i < --j); // no body in this loop

    System.out.println("Midpoint is " + i);
  }
}
```

This program finds the midpoint between `i` and `j`. It generates the following output:

```text
Midpoint is 150
```

Here is how this `while` loop works. The value of `i` is incremented, and the value of `j` is decremented. These values are then compared with one another. If the new value of `i` is still less than the new value of `j`, then the loop repeats. If `i` is equal to or greater than `j`, the loop stops. Upon exit from the loop, `i` will hold a value that is midway between the original values of `i` and `j`.

<!-- CR p.97 -->

(Of course, this procedure only works when `i` is less than `j` to begin with.) As you can see, there is no need for a loop body; all of the action occurs within the conditional expression, itself. In professionally written Java code, short loops are frequently coded without bodies when the controlling expression can handle all of the details itself.

### do-while

As you just saw, if the conditional expression controlling a `while` loop is initially false, then the body of the loop will not be executed at all. However, sometimes it is desirable to execute the body of a loop at least once, even if the conditional expression is false to begin with. In other words, there are times when you would like to test the termination expression at the end of the loop rather than at the beginning. Fortunately, Java supplies a loop that does just that: the `do-while`. The `do-while` loop always executes its body at least once, because its conditional expression is at the bottom of the loop. Its general form is

do { // body of loop } while (*condition*);

Each iteration of the `do-while` loop first executes the body of the loop and then evaluates the conditional expression. If this expression is true, the loop will repeat. Otherwise, the loop terminates. As with all of Java’s loops, *condition* must be a Boolean expression.

Here is a reworked version of the “tick” program that demonstrates the `do-while` loop. It generates the same output as before.

```java
// Demonstrate the do-while loop.
class DoWhile {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 10;

    do {
      System.out.println("tick " + n);
      n--;
    } while(n > 0);
  }
}
```

The loop in the preceding program, while technically correct, can be written more efficiently as follows:

```java
do {
  System.out.println("tick " + n);
} while(--n > 0);
```

In this example, the expression **(– –n > 0)** combines the decrement of `n` and the test for zero into one expression. Here is how it works. First, the **– –n** statement executes, decrementing `n` and returning the new value of `n`. This value is then compared with zero. If it is greater than zero, the loop continues; otherwise, it terminates.

<!-- CR p.98 -->

The `do-while` loop is especially useful when you process a menu selection, because you will usually want the body of a menu loop to execute at least once. Consider the following program, which implements a very simple help system for Java’s selection and iteration statements:

```java
// Using a do-while to process a menu selection
class Menu {
  public static void main(String[] args)
    throws java.io.IOException {
    char choice;

    do {
      System.out.println("Help on: ");
      System.out.println("  1. if");
      System.out.println("  2. switch");
      System.out.println("  3. while");
      System.out.println("  4. do-while");
      System.out.println("  5. for\n");
      System.out.println("Choose one:");
      choice = (char) System.in.read();
    } while( choice < '1' || choice > '5');

    System.out.println("\n");

    switch(choice) {
      case '1':
        System.out.println("The if:\n");
        System.out.println("if(condition) statement;");
        System.out.println("else statement;");
        break;
      case '2':
        System.out.println("The switch:\n");
        System.out.println("switch(expression) {");
        System.out.println("  case constant:");
        System.out.println("    statement sequence");
        System.out.println("    break;");
        System.out.println("  //...");
        System.out.println("}");
        break;
      case '3':
        System.out.println("The while:\n");
        System.out.println("while(condition) statement;");
        break;
      case '4':
        System.out.println("The do-while:\n");
        System.out.println("do {");
        System.out.println("  statement;");
        System.out.println("} while (condition);");
        break;
      case '5':
        System.out.println("The for:\n");
        System.out.print("for(init; condition; iteration)");
        System.out.println(" statement;");
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- CR p.99 -->

Here is a sample run produced by this program:

```java
Help on:
  1. if
  2. switch
  3. while
  4. do-while
  5. for
Choose one:
4
The do-while:
do {
  statement;
} while (condition);
```

In the program, the `do-while` loop is used to verify that the user has entered a valid choice. If not, then the user is reprompted. Since the menu must be displayed at least once, the `do-while` is the perfect loop to accomplish this.

A few other points about this example: Notice that characters are read from the keyboard by calling **System.in.read( )**. This is one of Java’s console input functions. Although Java’s console I/O methods won’t be discussed in detail until Chapter 13, **System.in.read( )** is used here to obtain the user’s choice. It reads characters from standard input (returned as integers, which is why the return value was cast to `char`). By default, standard input is line buffered, so you must press enter before any characters that you type will be sent to your program.

Java’s console input can be a bit awkward to work with. Further, most real-world Java programs will use a graphical user interface (GUI). For these reasons, not much use of console input has been made in this book. However, it is useful in this context. One other point to consider: Because **System.in.read( )** is being used, the program must specify the **throws java** `.io.IOException` clause. This line is necessary to handle input errors. It is part of Java’s exception handling features, which are discussed in Chapter 10.

### for

You were introduced to a simple form of the `for` loop in Chapter 2. As you will see, it is a powerful and versatile construct.

There are two forms of the `for` loop. The first is the traditional form that has been in use since the original version of Java. The second is the newer “for-each” form, added by JDK 5. Both types of `for` loops are discussed here, beginning with the traditional form.

Here is the general form of the traditional `for` statement:

for(*initialization*; *condition*; *iteration*) { // body }

If only one statement is being repeated, there is no need for the curly braces.

The `for` loop operates as follows. When the loop first starts, the *initialization* portion of the loop is executed. Generally, this is an expression that sets the value of the *loop control variable*, which acts as a counter that controls the loop. It is important to understand that the initialization expression is executed only once. Next, *condition* is evaluated. This must be a Boolean expression.

<!-- CR p.100 -->

It usually tests the loop control variable against a target value. If this expression is true, then the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the loop terminates. Next, the *iteration* portion of the loop is executed. This is usually an expression that increments or decrements the loop control variable. The loop then iterates, first evaluating the conditional expression, then executing the body of the loop, and then executing the iteration expression with each pass. This process repeats until the controlling expression is false.

Here is a version of the “tick” program that uses a `for` loop:

```java
// Demonstrate the for loop.
class ForTick {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n;

    for(n=10; n>0; n--)
      System.out.println("tick " + n);
  }
}

##### Declaring Loop Control Variables Inside the for Loop

Often the variable that controls a `for` loop is needed only for the purposes of the loop and is not used elsewhere. When this is the case, it is possible to declare the variable inside the initialization portion of the `for`. For example, here is the preceding program recoded so that the loop control variable `n` is declared as an `int` inside the `for`:

```java
// Declare a loop control variable inside the for.
class ForTick {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // here, n is declared inside of the for loop
    for(int n=10; n>0; n--)
      System.out.println("tick " + n);
  }
}
```

When you declare a variable inside a `for` loop, there is one important point to remember: the scope of that variable ends when the `for` statement does. (That is, the scope of the variable is limited to the `for` loop.) Outside the `for` loop, the variable will cease to exist. If you need to use the loop control variable elsewhere in your program, you will not be able to declare it inside the `for` loop.

When the loop control variable will not be needed elsewhere, most Java programmers declare it inside the `for`. For example, here is a simple program that tests for prime numbers. Notice that the loop control variable, `i`, is declared inside the `for` since it is not needed elsewhere.

```java
// Test for primes.
class FindPrime {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num;
    boolean isPrime;

    num = 14;
    if(num < 2) isPrime = false;
    else isPrime = true;

    for(int i=2; i <= num/i; i++) {
      if((num % i) == 0) {
        isPrime = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    if(isPrime) System.out.println("Prime");
    else System.out.println("Not Prime");
  }
}
```

##### Using the Comma

There will be times when you will want to include more than one statement in the initialization and iteration portions of the `for` loop. For example, consider the loop in the following program:

```java
class Sample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a, b;

    b = 4;
    for(a=1; a<b; a++) {
      System.out.println("a = " + a);
      System.out.println("b = " + b);
      b--;
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, the loop is controlled by the interaction of two variables. Since the loop is governed by two variables, it would be useful if both could be included in the `for` statement, itself, instead of `b` being handled manually. Fortunately, Java provides a way to accomplish this. To allow two or more variables to control a `for` loop, Java permits you to include multiple statements in both the initialization and iteration portions of the `for`. Each statement is separated from the next by a comma.

Using the comma, the preceding `for` loop can be more efficiently coded, as shown here:

```java
// Using the comma.
class Comma {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a, b;

    for(a=1, b=4; a<b; a++, b--) {
      System.out.println("a = " + a);
      System.out.println("b = " + b);
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- CR p.102 -->

In this example, the initialization portion sets the values of both `a` and `b`. The two comma-separated statements in the iteration portion are executed each time the loop repeats. The program generates the following output:

```text
a = 1
b = 4
a = 2
b = 3
```

##### Some for Loop Variations

The `for` loop supports a number of variations that increase its power and applicability. The reason it is so flexible is that its three parts—the initialization, the conditional test, and the iteration—do not need to be used for only those purposes. In fact, the three sections of the `for` can be used for any purpose you desire. Let’s look at some examples.

One of the most common variations involves the conditional expression. Specifically, this expression does not need to test the loop control variable against some target value. In fact, the condition controlling the `for` can be any Boolean expression. For example, consider the following fragment:

```java
boolean done = false;

for(int i=1; !done; i++) {
  // ...
  if(interrupted()) done = true;
}
```

In this example, the `for` loop continues to run until the `boolean` variable `done` is set to `true`. It does not test the value of `i`.

Here is another interesting `for` loop variation. Either the initialization or the iteration expression or both may be absent, as in this next program:

```java
// Parts of the for loop can be empty.
class ForVar {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i;
    boolean done = false;

    i = 0;
    for( ; !done; ) {
      System.out.println("i is " + i);
      if(i == 10) done = true;
      i++;
    }
  }
}
```

Here, the initialization and iteration expressions have been moved out of the `for`. Thus, parts of the `for` are empty. While this is of no value in this simple example—indeed, it would be considered quite poor style—there can be times when this type of approach makes sense.

<!-- CR p.103 -->

For example, if the initial condition is set through a complex expression elsewhere in the program or if the loop control variable changes in a nonsequential manner determined by actions that occur within the body of the loop, it may be appropriate to leave these parts of the `for` empty.

Here is one more `for` loop variation. You can intentionally create an infinite loop (a loop that never terminates) if you leave all three parts of the `for` empty. For example:

```java
for( ; ; ) {
  // ...
}
```

This loop will run forever because there is no condition under which it will terminate. Although there are some programs, such as operating system command processors, that require an infinite loop, most “infinite loops” are really just loops with special termination requirements. As you will soon see, there is a way to terminate a loop—even an infinite loop like the one shown—that does not make use of the normal loop conditional expression.

### The For-Each Version of the for Loop

A second form of `for` implements a “for-each” style loop. As you may know, contemporary language theory has embraced the for-each concept, and it has become a standard feature that programmers have come to expect. A for-each style loop is designed to cycle through a collection of objects, such as an array, in strictly sequential fashion, from start to finish. In Java, the for-each style of `for` is also referred to as the *enhanced* `for` loop.

The general form of the for-each version of the `for` is shown here:

for(*type itr-var* : *collection*) *statement-block*

Here, *type* specifies the type and *itr-var* specifies the name of an *iteration variable* that will receive the elements from a collection, one at a time, from beginning to end. The collection being cycled through is specified by *collection*. There are various types of collections that can be used with the `for`, but the only type used in this chapter is the array. (Other types of collections that can be used with the `for`, such as those defined by the Collections Framework, are discussed later in this book.) With each iteration of the loop, the next element in the collection is retrieved and stored in *itr-var*. The loop repeats until all elements in the collection have been obtained.

Because the iteration variable receives values from the collection, *type* must be the same as (or compatible with) the elements stored in the collection. Thus, when iterating over arrays, *type* must be compatible with the element type of the array.

To understand the motivation behind a for-each style loop, consider the type of `for` loop that it is designed to replace. The following fragment uses a traditional `for` loop to compute the sum of the values in an array:

```java
int[] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
int sum = 0;

for(int i=0; i < 10; i++) sum += nums[i];
```

<!-- CR p.104 -->

To compute the sum, each element in `nums` is read, in order, from start to finish. Thus, the entire array is read in strictly sequential order. This is accomplished by manually indexing the `nums` array by `i`, the loop control variable.

The for-each style `for` automates the preceding loop. Specifically, it eliminates the need to establish a loop counter, specify a starting and ending value, and manually index the array. Instead, it automatically cycles through the entire array, obtaining one element at a time, in sequence, from beginning to end. For example, here is the preceding fragment rewritten using a for-each version of the `for`:

```java
int[] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
int sum = 0;

for(int x: nums) sum += x;
```

With each pass through the loop, `x` is automatically given a value equal to the next element in `nums`. Thus, on the first iteration, `x` contains 1; on the second iteration, `x` contains 2; and so on. Not only is the syntax streamlined, but it also prevents boundary errors.

Here is an entire program that demonstrates the for-each version of the `for` just described:

```java
// Use a for-each style for loop.
class ForEach {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
    int sum = 0;

    // use for-each style for to display and sum the values
    for(int x : nums) {
      System.out.println("Value is: " + x);
      sum += x;
    }

    System.out.println("Summation: " + sum);
  }
}
```

The output from the program is shown here:

```text
Value is: 1
Value is: 2
Value is: 3
Value is: 4
Value is: 5
Value is: 6
Value is: 7
Value is: 8
Value is: 9
Value is: 10
Summation: 55
```

As this output shows, the for-each style `for` automatically cycles through an array in sequence from the lowest index to the highest.

<!-- CR p.105 -->

Although the for-each `for` loop iterates until all elements in an array have been examined, it is possible to terminate the loop early by using a `break` statement. For example, this program sums only the first five elements of `nums`:

```java
// Use break with a for-each style for.
class ForEach2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int sum = 0;
    int[] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

    // use for to display and sum the values
    for(int x : nums) {
      System.out.println("Value is: " + x);
      sum += x;
      if(x == 5) break; // stop the loop when 5 is obtained
    }
    System.out.println("Summation of first 5 elements: " + sum);
  }
}
```

This is the output produced:

```text
Value is: 1
Value is: 2
Value is: 3
Value is: 4
Value is: 5
Summation of first 5 elements: 15
```

As is evident, the `for` loop stops after the fifth element has been obtained. The `break` statement can also be used with Java’s other loops, and it is discussed in detail later in this chapter.

There is one important point to understand about the for-each style loop. Its iteration variable is “read-only” as it relates to the underlying array. An assignment to the iteration variable has no effect on the underlying array. In other words, you can’t change the contents of the array by assigning the iteration variable a new value. For example, consider this program:

```java
// The for-each loop is essentially read-only.
class NoChange {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

    for(int x: nums) {
      System.out.print(x + " ");
      x = x * 10; // no effect on nums
    }

    System.out.println();

    for(int x : nums)
      System.out.print(x + " ");

    System.out.println();
  }
}
```

<!-- CR p.106 -->

The first `for` loop increases the value of the iteration variable by a factor of 10. However, this assignment has no effect on the underlying array `nums`, as the second `for` loop illustrates. The output, shown here, proves this point:

```text
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

##### Iterating Over Multidimensional Arrays

The enhanced version of the `for` also works on multidimensional arrays. Remember, however, that in Java, multidimensional arrays consist of *arrays of arrays*. (For example, a two-dimensional array is an array of one-dimensional arrays.) This is important when iterating over a multidimensional array, because each iteration obtains the *next array*, not an individual element. Furthermore, the iteration variable in the `for` loop must be compatible with the type of array being obtained. For example, in the case of a two-dimensional array, the iteration variable must be a reference to a one-dimensional array. In general, when using the for-each `for` to iterate over an array of *N* dimensions, the objects obtained will be arrays of *N*–1 dimensions. To understand the implications of this, consider the following program. It uses nested `for` loops to obtain the elements of a two-dimensional array in row-order, from first to last.

```java
// Use for-each style for on a two-dimensional array.
class ForEach3 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int sum = 0;
    int[][] nums = new int[3][5];

    // give nums some values
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
      for(int j = 0; j < 5; j++)
        nums[i][j] = (i+1)*(j+1);

    // use for-each for to display and sum the values
    for(int[] x : nums) {
      for(int y : x) {
        System.out.println("Value is: " + y);
        sum += y;
      }
    }
    System.out.println("Summation: " + sum);
  }
}
```

The output from this program is shown here:

```text
Value is: 1
Value is: 2
Value is: 3
Value is: 4
Value is: 5
Value is: 2
Value is: 4
Value is: 6
Value is: 8
Value is: 10
Value is: 3
Value is: 6
Value is: 9
Value is: 12
Value is: 15
Summation: 90
```

<!-- CR p.107 -->

In the program, pay special attention to this line:

```java
for(int[] x: nums) {
```

Notice how `x` is declared. It is a reference to a one-dimensional array of integers. This is necessary because each iteration of the `for` obtains the next *array* in `nums`, beginning with the array specified by `nums[0]`. The inner `for` loop then cycles through each of these arrays, displaying the values of each element.

##### Applying the Enhanced for

Since the for-each style `for` can only cycle through an array sequentially, from start to finish, you might think that its use is limited, but this is not true. A large number of algorithms require exactly this mechanism. One of the most common is searching. For example, the following program uses a `for` loop to search an unsorted array for a value. It stops if the value is found.

```java
// Search an array using for-each style for.
class Search {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] nums = { 6, 8, 3, 7, 5, 6, 1, 4 };
    int val = 5;
    boolean found = false;

    // use for-each style for to search nums for val
    for(int x : nums) {
      if(x == val) {
        found = true;
        break;
      }
    }

    if(found)
      System.out.println("Value found!");
  }
}
```

The for-each style `for` is an excellent choice in this application because searching an unsorted array involves examining each element in sequence. (Of course, if the array were sorted, a binary search could be used, which would require a different style loop.) Other types of applications that benefit from for-each style loops include computing an average, finding the minimum or maximum of a set, looking for duplicates, and so on.

Although we have been using arrays in the examples in this chapter, the for-each style `for` is especially useful when operating on collections defined by the Collections Framework, which is described in Part II. More generally, the `for` can cycle through the elements of any collection of objects, as long as that collection satisfies a certain set of constraints, which are described in Chapter 20.

<!-- CR p.108 -->

### Local Variable Type Inference in a for Loop

As explained in Chapter 3, JDK 10 introduced a feature called *local variable type inference,* which allows the type of a local variable to be inferred from the type of its initializer. To use local variable type inference, the type of the variable is specified as `var` and the variable must be initialized. Local variable type inference can be used in a `for` loop when declaring and initializing the loop control variable inside a traditional `for` loop, or when specifying the iteration variable in a for-each `for`. The following program shows an example of each case:

```java
// Use type inference in a for loop.
class TypeInferenceInFor {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Use type inference with the loop control variable.
    System.out.print("Values of x: ");
    for(var x = 2.5; x < 100.0; x = x * 2)
      System.out.print(x + " ");

    System.out.println();

    // Use type inference with the iteration variable.
    int[] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    System.out.print("Values in nums array: ");
    for(var v : nums)
      System.out.print(v + " ");

    System.out.println();
  }
}
```

The output is shown here:

```text
Values of x: 2.5 5.0 10.0 20.0 40.0 80.0
Values in nums array: 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

In this example, loop control variable `x` in this line:

```java
for(var x = 2.5; x < 100.0; x = x * 2)
```

is inferred to be type `double` because that is the type of its initializer. Iteration variable `v` is this line:

```text
for(var v : nums)
```

inferred to be of type `int` because that is the element type of the array `nums`.

One last point: Because a number of readers will be working in environments that predate JDK 10, local variable type inference will not be used by most of the `for` loops in the remainder of this edition of this book. You should, of course, consider it for new code that you write.

<!-- CR p.109 -->

### Nested Loops

Like all other programming languages, Java allows loops to be nested. That is, one loop may be inside another. For example, here is a program that nests `for` loops:

```java
// Loops may be nested.
class Nested {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i, j;

    for(i=0; i<10; i++) {
      for(j=i; j<10; j++)
        System.out.print(".");
      System.out.println();
    }
  }
}
```

The output produced by this program is shown here:

```text
..........
.........
........
.......
......
.....
....
...
..
.
```

## Jump Statements

Java supports three jump statements: `break`, `continue`, and `return`. These statements transfer control to another part of your program. Each is examined here.

**NOTE** In addition to the jump statements discussed here, Java supports one other way that you can change

your program’s flow of execution: through exception handling. Exception handling provides a structured method by which run-time errors can be trapped and handled by your program. It is supported by the keywords `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally`. In essence, the exception handling mechanism allows your program to perform a nonlocal branch. Since exception handling is a large topic, it is discussed in its own chapter, Chapter 10.

### Using break

In Java, the `break` statement has three uses. First, as you have seen, it terminates a statement sequence in a `switch` statement. Second, it can be used to exit a loop. Third, it can be used as a “civilized” form of goto. The last two uses are explained here.

<!-- CR p.110 -->

##### Using break to Exit a Loop

By using `break`, you can force immediate termination of a loop, bypassing the conditional expression and any remaining code in the body of the loop. When a `break` statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is terminated and program control resumes at the next statement following the loop. Here is a simple example:

```java
// Using break to exit a loop.
class BreakLoop {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for(int i=0; i<100; i++) {
      if(i == 10) break; // terminate loop if i is 10
      System.out.println("i: " + i);
    }
    System.out.println("Loop complete.");
  }
}
```

This program generates the following output:

```text
i: 0
i: 1
i: 2
i: 3
i: 4
i: 5
i: 6
i: 7
i: 8
i: 9
Loop complete.
```

As you can see, although the `for` loop is designed to run from 0 to 99, the `break` statement causes it to terminate early, when `i` equals 10.

The `break` statement can be used with any of Java’s loops, including intentionally infinite loops. For example, here is the preceding program coded by use of a `while` loop. The output from this program is the same as just shown.

```java
// Using break to exit a while loop.
class BreakLoop2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 0;

    while(i < 100) {
      if(i == 10) break; // terminate loop if i is 10
      System.out.println("i: " + i);
      i++;
    }
    System.out.println("Loop complete.");
  }
}
```

<!-- CR p.111 -->

When used inside a set of nested loops, the `break` statement will only break out of the innermost loop. For example:

```java
// Using break with nested loops.
class BreakLoop3 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {
      System.out.print("Pass " + i + ": ");
      for(int j=0; j<100; j++) {
        if(j == 10) break; // terminate loop if j is 10
        System.out.print(j + " ");
      }
      System.out.println();
    }
    System.out.println("Loops complete.");
  }
}
```

This program generates the following output:

```text
Pass 0: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Pass 1: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Pass 2: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Loops complete.
```

As you can see, the `break` statement in the inner loop only causes termination of that loop. The outer loop is unaffected.

Here are two other points to remember about `break`. First, more than one `break` statement may appear in a loop. However, be careful. Too many `break` statements have the tendency to destructure your code. Second, the `break` that terminates a `switch` statement affects only that `switch` statement and not any enclosing loops.

**REMEMBER** `break` was not designed to provide the normal means by which a loop is terminated. The loop’s

conditional expression serves this purpose. The `break` statement should be used to cancel a loop only when some sort of special situation occurs.

##### Using break as a Form of Goto

In addition to its uses with the `switch` statement and loops, the `break` statement can also be employed by itself to provide a “civilized” form of the goto statement. Java does not have a goto statement because it provides a way to branch in an arbitrary and unstructured manner. This usually makes goto-ridden code hard to understand and hard to maintain. It also prohibits certain compiler optimizations. There are, however, a few places where the goto is a valuable and legitimate construct for flow control. For example, the goto can be useful when you are exiting from a deeply nested set of loops. To handle such situations, Java defines an expanded form of the `break` statement. By using this form of `break`, you can, for example, break out of one or more blocks of code. These blocks need not be part of a loop or a `switch`. They can be any block. Further, you can specify precisely where execution will resume, because this form of `break` works with a label. As you will see, `break` gives you the benefits of a goto without its problems.

<!-- CR p.112 -->

The general form of the labeled `break` statement is shown here:

break *label*;

Most often, *label* is the name of a label that identifies a block of code. This can be a stand-alone block of code but it can also be a block that is the target of another statement. When this form of `break` executes, control is transferred out of the named block. The labeled block must enclose the `break` statement, but it does not need to be the immediately enclosing block. This means, for example, that you can use a labeled `break` statement to exit from a set of nested blocks. But you cannot use `break` to transfer control out of a block that does not enclose the `break` statement.

To name a block, put a label at the start of it. A *label* is any valid Java identifier followed by a colon. Once you have labeled a block, you can then use this label as the target of a `break` statement. Doing so causes execution to resume at the *end* of the labeled block. For example, the following program shows three nested blocks, each with its own label. The `break` statement causes execution to jump forward, past the end of the block labeled `second`, skipping the two **println( )** statements.

```java
// Using break as a civilized form of goto.
class Break {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean t = true;

    first: {
      second: {
        third: {
          System.out.println("Before the break.");
          if(t) break second; // break out of second block
          System.out.println("This won't execute");
        }
        System.out.println("This won't execute");
      }
      System.out.println("This is after second block.");
    }
  }
}
```

Running this program generates the following output:

```text
Before the break.
This is after second block.
```

One of the most common uses for a labeled `break` statement is to exit from nested loops. For example, in the following program, the outer loop executes only once:

```java
// Using break to exit from nested loops
class BreakLoop4 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    outer: for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {
      System.out.print("Pass " + i + ": ");
      for(int j=0; j<100; j++) {
        if(j == 10) break outer; // exit both loops
        System.out.print(j + " ");
      }
      System.out.println("This will not print");
    }
    System.out.println("Loops complete.");
  }
}
```

<!-- CR p.113 -->

This program generates the following output:

```text
Pass 0: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Loops complete.

As you can see, when the inner loop breaks to the outer loop, both loops have been terminated. Notice that this example labels the `for` statement, which has a block of code as its target.

Keep in mind that you cannot break to any label which is not defined for an enclosing block. For example, the following program is invalid and will not compile:

```java
// This program contains an error.
class BreakErr {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    one: for(int i=0; i<3; i++) {
      System.out.print("Pass " + i + ": ");
    }

    for(int j=0; j<100; j++) {
      if(j == 10) break one; // WRONG
      System.out.print(j + " ");
    }
  }
}
```

Since the loop labeled `one` does not enclose the `break` statement, it is not possible to transfer control out of that block.

### Using continue

Sometimes it is useful to force an early iteration of a loop. That is, you might want to continue running the loop but stop processing the remainder of the code in its body for this particular iteration. This is, in effect, a goto just past the body of the loop, to the loop’s end. The `continue` statement performs such an action. In `while` and `do-while` loops, a `continue` statement causes control to be transferred directly to the conditional expression that controls the loop. In a `for` loop, control goes first to the iteration portion of the `for` statement and then to the conditional expression. For all three loops, any intermediate code is bypassed.

Here is an example program that uses `continue` to cause two numbers to be printed on each line:

```java
// Demonstrate continue.
class Continue {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
      System.out.print(i + " ");
      if (i%2 == 0) continue;
      System.out.println("");
    }
  }
}
```

This code uses the % operator to check if `i` is even. If it is, the loop continues without printing a newline. Here is the output from this program:

```text
0 1
2 3
4 5
6 7
8 9
```

As with the `break` statement, `continue` may specify a label to describe which enclosing loop to continue. Here is an example program that uses `continue` to print a triangular multiplication table for 0 through 9:

```java
// Using continue with a label.
class ContinueLabel {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
outer: for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
         for(int j=0; j<10; j++) {
           if(j > i) {
             System.out.println();
             continue outer;
           }
           System.out.print(" " + (i * j));
         }
       }
       System.out.println();
  }
}
```

The `continue` statement in this example terminates the loop counting `j` and continues with the next iteration of the loop counting `i`. Here is the output of this program:

```text
0
0 1
0 2 4
0 3 6 9
0 4 8 12 16
0 5 10 15 20 25
0 6 12 18 24 30 36
0 7 14 21 28 35 42 49
0 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64
0 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81
```

Good uses of `continue` are rare. One reason is that Java provides a rich set of loop statements which fit most applications. However, for those special circumstances in which early iteration is needed, the `continue` statement provides a structured way to accomplish it.

### return

The last control statement is `return`. The `return` statement is used to explicitly return from a method. That is, it causes program control to transfer back to the caller of the method. As such, it is categorized as a jump statement. Although a full discussion of `return` must wait until methods are discussed in Chapter 6, a brief look at `return` is presented here.

At any time in a method, the `return` statement can be used to cause execution to branch back to the caller of the method. Thus, the `return` statement immediately terminates the method in which it is executed. The following example illustrates this point. Here, `return` causes execution to return to the Java run-time system, since it is the run-time system that calls **main( )**:

```java
// Demonstrate return.
class Return {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean t = true;

    System.out.println("Before the return.");

    if(t) return; // return to caller

    System.out.println("This won't execute.");
  }
}
```

The output from this program is shown here:

```text
Before the return.
```

As you can see, the final **println( )** statement is not executed. As soon as `return` is executed, control passes back to the caller.

One last point: In the preceding program, the `if(t)` statement is necessary. Without it, the Java compiler would flag an “unreachable code” error because the compiler would know that the last **println( )** statement would never be executed. To prevent this error, the `if` statement is used here to trick the compiler for the sake of this demonstration.
